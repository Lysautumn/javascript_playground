## GitHub 30 Day Challenge -- Sprint 1

This is the repository for some of my work for my first sprint of the 30 day GitHub Challenge. For the first sprint, I chose to focus on JavaScript and jQuery.

This repository contains the following files:

- index.html
- style.css
- app.js

### index.html
This file currently has basic structure for a web page. This may change as I work on learning more.

### style.css
This file will be for CSS styling, which isn't part of the scope of what I am working on for this GitHub challenge, but I will still work on it to keep improving my CSS abilities.

### app.js
This is the file that will contain most of the code I will write for this sprint of the GitHub challenge. I will also work on other files, but this file is mostly for experimentation.
